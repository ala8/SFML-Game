This project requires SFML's include and lib directories, get them from: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

For people that find this complicated:
1. Open https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/ on your internet browser
2. Download the compatible one to your compiler. (Visual Studio 2019 has Visual C++ 15 by default)
3. extract (unzip) the folder and copy the "include" and "lib" folders.
4. paste them into this folder.


NOTE: Make sure you keep them untouched, modifying/deleting them will result in compiling errors/game crashing.
